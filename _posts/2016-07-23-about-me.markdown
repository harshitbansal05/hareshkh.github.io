I am a Computer Science sophomore at [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee][IITR].

I was born and raised in Amritsar, Punjab and did my schooling from [DAV International School, Amritsar][DAVIS]. From childhood I have been interested in many things and tried hands on various activities ranging from harmonium to guitar to skating to badminton and what not. Along with all this I was also good at studies and then cleared JEE Advanced with AIR 392 and landed up in IIT Roorkee, a decision which I will never regret.

I had started programming in C and slowly I have learnt C++, Java, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

Anything relating to computers interests me but Android Development and Web Development are my personal favorites. I am a foodie and I love swimming (though I am still in the learning phase). I also like to scribble at times but mostly on a piece of paper.

I'm a Android App developer at [Mobile Development Group (MDG)][MDG], a group promoting android app development in IIT Roorkee.

I'm a News Editor at [WatchOut! News Agency][WoNA], the official new magazine of IIT Roorkee.
